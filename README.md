# healthi Patient Portal

A CRUD Application for registering patients for treatment at local Sexual Health Clinics

# Technologies Used
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, Github, Auth0

## Approach to Development
This project was based on an existing project that I was attempting to replicate
[NYC Health Patient Portal](https://patientportal.cityofnewyork.us/pp-web/login)

and so there was an idea for the overall layout of the site.

With more time and understanding I'll work on implimenting the patient side of the application where patients will be able to log in and view their health record.
